## 📁 Files Modified

### Backend Files:

1. **`backend/src/controllers/review.controller.js`**
   - Added `getOwnerRatings()` function
   - Aggregates all reviews for owner's PGs
   - Calculates average rating and distribution
   - Formats data for frontend consumption

2. **`backend/src/routes/owner.routes.js`**
   - Added route: `GET /api/owner/ratings`
   - Protected with `requireAuth` and `requireOwner` middleware

### Frontend Files:

3. **`owner/src/features/ratings/slice.js`**
   - Updated API endpoint from `/api/ratings` to `/api/owner/ratings`

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Owner logs in** → Gets authenticated
2. **Navigates to Ratings page** → Frontend calls `fetchRatings()`
3. **API request** → `GET /api/owner/ratings`
4. **Backend logic:**
   - Finds all PGs owned by the authenticated owner
   - Queries all reviews for those PGs
   - Populates PG title and user name
   - Calculates statistics (average, distribution)
   - Formats and returns data
5. **Frontend displays** → Shows ratings dashboard with real data

## 📊 Features

### Overview Statistics:
- ✅ Average rating across all PGs
- ✅ Total number of reviews
- ✅ Rating distribution (1-5 stars breakdown)

### Reviews List:
- ✅ PG name (populated from Pg model)
- ✅ Tenant name (populated from User model)
- ✅ Rating (1-5 stars)
- ✅ Comment text
- ✅ Review date (createdAt timestamp)
- ✅ Verified status
- ✅ Sorted by most recent first

## 🔐 Security

- **Authentication Required:** Only logged-in users can access
- **Owner Authorization:** Only owners can see their own PG ratings
- **Data Isolation:** Owners only see reviews for their own properties

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the API:

1. **Start backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Login as owner** (get auth token)

3. **Make request:**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/owner/ratings \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Cookie: token=YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

### Expected Behavior:

- **No reviews yet:** Returns empty arrays and zero statistics
- **With reviews:** Returns aggregated data with all reviews
- **Unauthorized:** Returns 401 error
- **Not an owner:** Returns 403 error

## 📝 Database Schema

### Review Model (existing):
```javascript
{
  pgId: ObjectId (ref: Pg),
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  rating: Number (1-5),
  comment: String,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add pagination** for large number of reviews
2. **Add filtering** by PG, rating, or date range
3. **Add reply functionality** for owners to respond
4. **Add review moderation** (hide/flag inappropriate reviews)
5. **Add email notifications** when new reviews are posted
6. **Add review analytics** (trends over time)

## ✅ Status

**READY TO USE** - The API is fully functional and integrated with the frontend!

When users add reviews through the client app, they will automatically appear in the owner's Ratings dashboard.
